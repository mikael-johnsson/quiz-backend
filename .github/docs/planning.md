## Add question amount to QuizForm

Short description

- Add a numeric `amount` input to the quiz creation form so users can choose how many questions to generate. The value should be propagated through the existing URL query flow and forwarded to the backend. The frontend will default to 10 (recommended), the backend default is 20, and the allowed range is 1–50.

Acceptance criteria

- The `QuizForm` UI includes a numeric `amount` input with `min=1`, `max=50` and a sensible default (10 client-side).
- Submitting the form includes `amount` in the URL query string (e.g., `?amount=5&themes=...`).
- The server-side page reads `searchParams.amount`, normalizes it (parseInt, fallback to backend default 20 if omitted), clamps to 1–50, and passes it to the `Quiz` component.
- `getQuestions()` in `quizService` accepts an `amount` and includes it in the backend request URL when present.

Files to change

- [src/components/quizForm/quizForm.tsx](src/components/quizForm/quizForm.tsx)
- [src/app/page.tsx](src/app/page.tsx)
- [src/components/quiz/quiz.tsx](src/components/quiz/quiz.tsx)
- [src/services/quizService.tsx](src/services/quizService.tsx)

Proposed API contract (query param)

- Parameter: `amount` (integer)
- Location: URL query string
- Example request: `GET /?generate=true&themes=science&amount=5`
- Validation: integer, >=1, <=50. If absent, backend uses its default (20).

Step-by-step implementation

1. Add numeric input to `QuizForm` with `name="amount"`, `type="number"`, `min=1`, `max=50`, `defaultValue=10` and inline helper text.
2. Confirm `handleSubmit` keeps `FormData` usage so `amount` is appended to `URLSearchParams` automatically.
3. Update `app/page.tsx` to parse `searchParams.amount`, `parseInt`, fallback to backend default `20` when missing, and clamp to 1–50.
4. Pass `amount` as a prop to the `Quiz` component.
5. Update `Quiz` to accept `amount` and forward it to `getQuestions()`.
6. Modify `src/services/quizService.tsx` `getQuestions()` to accept optional `amount?: number` and append `&amount=${amount}` when provided.
7. Add small unit tests to assert `amount` is forwarded from `Quiz` to `quizService` (mock service).
8. Manual verification: run the app, submit with different `amount` values, and confirm backend receives `amount` correctly; test edge values (0, 999) are clamped.

Testing / Verification

- Unit: mock `getQuestions()` and verify it is called with the parsed/clamped `amount`.
- Manual: fill form with `amount=5`, submit, inspect network/backend logs to confirm `amount=5`.
- Edge cases: no `amount`, `amount=0`, and `amount=999` — ensure normalization/clamping.

Effort estimate: small — ~1–2 hours including basic tests.

Notes / decisions

- Client-side default: 10 (recommended UX choice). Backend default remains 20; server-side parsing will use backend default when `amount` is omitted to avoid unexpected behavior.
- Allowed max: 50 (agreed). Server must also enforce this limit.
